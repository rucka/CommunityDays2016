#Step 3 - Web framework

##Build and Run
- run ```node install``` to install all external application and development dependences
- run ```npm run compile``` to transpile the code using [babel](https://babeljs.io)
- run ```npm run dev``` to launch the application
- open your browser and go to http://localhost:8000/home

###Note
the command ```npm run dev``` launches the application through [nodemon](http://nodemon.io) so the server will be restarted when the code changed (hot reload).
